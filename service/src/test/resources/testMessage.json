{"text": "Leah Galton's late goal earned Manchester United a draw against reigning Women's Super League champions Chelsea in an entertaining contest.\n\nThe visitors led when Fran Kirby's fine low cross was converted by Australia international Sam Kerr.\n\nGalton came close to an equaliser against the run of play when her header hit the bar late in the first half.\n\nBut the United striker then levelled with just over 10 minutes to go with a similar goal to Kerr's.\n\nAlthough Chelsea brought on record signing Pernille Harder they could not find a winner.\n\nChelsea, who went unbeaten in the curtailed 2019-20 season, opened their season with a 2-0 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield last week, but this was a first competitive game since 23 February.\n\nThe Blues went in front after a fairly even opening quarter when some incisive passing freed Kirby down the right and Kerr showed good strength to get the right side of her marker to score.\n\nKerr, who had been publicly backed by boss Emma Hayes after missing a number of chances in the win over City last week, then should have made it 2-0 following some slack passing from United, but slotted wide from 15 yards.\n\nShe was then denied by a strong save from United goalkeeper Mary Earps after a well-measured ball from Ji So-Yun played her in on goal.\n\nUnited almost levelled just before the break when Galton's header very nearly caught Chelsea goalkeeper Carly Telford out.\n\nKerr missed another opportunity to get her second before the hosts enjoyed a concerted spell of pressure.\n\nTelford was forced into a decent save from Katie Zelem's shot from outside the area as United showed why they finished fourth in their debut WSL campaign.\n\nChelsea rallied and Earps saved well from sub Erin Cuthbert before the Scotland international chose to try and pass rather than go for goal when she got free in the area.\n\nMoments later United had the goal their endeavour merited when Galton converted sub Jackie Groenen's low cross.\n\nChelsea reacted by bringing on Harder, the most expensive player in women's football history, who joined from beaten Champions League finalists Wolfsburg on Tuesday. \n\nBut she was unable to help her new team find a late winner in the final 10 minutes."}
